# Dice Game

- **Dice It** is a 2 player game with following rules:
  - A player continues to roll the dice until he decides to hold or he scores **1**.
  - While the player rolls dice everytime, the total score for current round increments with dice value.
  - If scored 1 , the player not only get switched. But the round score for the 1 scoring player is considered 0. To avoid such scenario, a player can hold to save the current round score.
  - The first player to reach a score of 100 wins the match
